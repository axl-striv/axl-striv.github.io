5. Calibration Issue
Hi [Name],
 Thank you for your message on the Striv After-Sales Service Request.
 This might be a calibration issue. Please go to your insole status page and press "Start Calibration".
 Stand still with weight evenly distributed on both feet for ~5 seconds until the LED turns off.
 After calibration, check if the “mean pressure” value changes when you step on the insoles.
 For more help, see: Troubleshooting Checklist and App Update Guide
 Thank you and have a great day!

 Emily
