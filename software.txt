### API Server Errors
**Issue:** "HTTP 429 too many requests" errors when accessing run summaries

**Symptoms:**
- Error occurs when ending runs
- Summary page fails to load
- Happens consistently on certain devices

**Response Protocol:**
```
Thank you for the detailed bug report. The "HTTP 429" error indicates our servers are receiving too many requests. This is a known issue our technical team is addressing.

As a temporary workaround:
- Wait 2-3 minutes before trying to access the summary
- Try accessing your run data from the main dashboard instead

We'll include your device information in our bug tracking system and notify you when this is resolved.
```

### Navigation & UI Issues
**Common Problems:**
- Summary button redirects to home instead of showing run history
- Unwanted training plans appearing automatically
- Difficulty finding standalone session options

**For Summary Navigation Issues:**
```
This appears to be a navigation bug in the current app version. Please try:
1. Force close and restart the app
2. Access your run history through Profile > Run History

If the issue persists, please share:
- Your device model and Android/iOS version
- App version number
- Screenshot of the issue
```

**For Training Plan Issues:**
```
You can disable automatic training plans by:
1. Go to Settings > Training Preferences
2. Turn off "Auto-generate training plans"
3. Select "Manual sessions only"

To record standalone sessions:
- Tap "Start Run" directly from the home screen
- Skip any training plan prompts

Would you like me to walk you through these settings?
```

### Hardware Pairing Issues
**Issue:** Customer receives two left pods instead of left/right pair

**Response Protocol:**
1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Apologize for shipping error
2. **Photo Verification**: Ask for photo showing both pods
3. **Replacement Process**: Ship correct right pod immediately
4. **Quality Control**: Note batch number for internal review

**Template Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I apologize for this shipping error. It appears you received two left pods instead of a left/right pair.

To resolve this quickly:
1. Can you send a photo showing both pods for our records?
2. We'll immediately ship the correct right pod to you
3. You can keep the extra left pod as backup

This should reach you within [shipping timeline].

Best,
[Your name]
